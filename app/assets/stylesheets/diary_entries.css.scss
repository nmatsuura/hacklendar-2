.calendar {
	td {
		width: 50px; 
		height: 50px;
	}
}

//Change height and width of calendar only (without .calendar will apply to all tables!)
//Can also nest rules without making a new line, but this is only specific to Rails (not to css)

// Place all the styles related to the diary_entries controller here.
// They will automatically be included in application.css.
// You can use Sass (SCSS) here: http://sass-lang.com/
